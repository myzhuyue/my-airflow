Since pymssql is not well maintained, project need to switch to pyodbc in order to connect to Microsoft SQL Server.

A well defined package by @mike-hosseini is found as a airflow-sql-server-plugin already solved the problem.

Another issue is Airflow2.0.0 at this moment is not support python3.9.1 as well as pymssql which only support python3.8

New helpful package and plugins are continue be found around Apache Airflow, thanks for all the engineers!
